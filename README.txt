My 3d Game of Life has 5 classes. The sample class is where the sample application runs. It has two inner classes
a GameLoop class and a MenuListener. Another class that I have is the Cells class. This is the class that holds all the
information of each cell, if it is alive, dead, dying or becoming alive. The sample logic of the game is stored in the
GameEngine class. This is where I have two boards that each get updated. The final class that I created is the scroll class.
This class is the event listener for the slider change and the mouse scroll. I also took the Xform class from the java
tutorial.
